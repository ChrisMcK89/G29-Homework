Q1. What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?

It allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

Q2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example?

Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do different things based on the object
that it is acting upon. A good example of this would be an animal class that has a method sound().
as it is a generic class we can't implement this. We can have Horse and Cat that can inherit the
sound() method and can "Neigh" and "Meow". The action it performs is based on the object.

Q3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

We can use a combination of methods, inheritance, super/sub classes and interfaces.

Q4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.

Q5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

You could use this when there are many classes that are related to each other and that they would
use the same methods.
